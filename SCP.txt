SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) helps to transfer computer files securely from a local to a remote host.
It is similar to FTP but it adds security and authentication.
Default SCP Port = 22(same as SSH)

-----transfer file from local server to remote server-----
# Login as yourself 
# touch fileName
$ scp fileName userName@192.168.1.x:/remote/directory/
# Enter userName and Password

-----transfer file from remote server to local server-----
$ scp userName@192.168.1.x:file.txt /local/directory/

*** If you want to copy directory from local to remote server or vice-versa, use scp -r .
